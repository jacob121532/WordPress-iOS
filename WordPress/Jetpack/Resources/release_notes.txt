We added an Optimize Images setting so newly uploaded images are optimal size and quality by default. You can also delete images, videos, and other media in the Media screen in My Sites.

Still want more media support? You’re in luck: thumbnails and original images now load faster in the Site Media screen, and GIF thumbnails are properly animated. We also added buttons so you can select and deselect your media files in preview mode.

In the block editor, you’ll only see the “ungroup” option for nested blocks if those blocks actually support it. Oh, and we added a native photo picker to the story editor.

We fixed the media item details screen for iPad users and squashed a bug on the Stats screen, so sites now open when you click their URLs. We also solved a migration issue for WordPress users whose accounts don’t have any sites. The “Uninstall WordPress” prompt now lives in your dashboard, too.

Finally, your list of site pages now loads faster. Yes, even when your site has hundreds of pages. And yes, we’re just that good.
